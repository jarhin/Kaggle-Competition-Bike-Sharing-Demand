 We show how the Forecast package in R can be used to solve a Kaggle Problem predicting the use of a city bike share system.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Kaggle Problem}

We acknowledge that the data for this problem is attributed to \cite{RProj}. 

For the benefit of the reader, we reproduce the details of the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle Competition as described in the URL \url{http://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand}.

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this Kaggle competition, we are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

\subsubsection{Bike Data}

We are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this Kaggle competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. We predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.

We show the variables of the data-set together with their meaning in Table~\ref{tab:datafields}.

\subsubsection{R Setup}


In this report, we use an an Intel i7 PC with 16GB RAM. The operating system is the Linux distribution OpenSUSE. 

We use R \cite{RProj} Version 3.1.1.

We use R together with Project Template \cite{ProjectTemplate2014}, ggplot2 and the Forecast packages.

\section{Exploratory Data analysis}
\section{Methodology}
\section{Results}
\section{Conclusion}

This is a demo for using the \verb@Sweave@ command in R.  To
get started make a regular \LaTeX\ file (like this one) but
give it the suffix \verb@.Rnw@ instead of \verb@.tex@ and then
turn it into a \LaTeX\ file (\verb@foo.tex@) with the (unix) command
\begin{verbatim}
R CMD Sweave foo.Rnw
\end{verbatim}
So you can do
\begin{verbatim}
latex foo
xdvi foo
\end{verbatim}
and so forth.

So now we have a more complicated file chain
$$
\begin{CD}
   \texttt{foo.Rnw}
   @>\texttt{Sweave}>>
   \texttt{foo.tex}
   @>\texttt{latex}>>
   \texttt{foo.dvi}
   @>\texttt{xdvi}>>
   \text{view of document}
\end{CD}
$$
and what have we accomplished other than making it twice as annoying
to the WYSIWYG crowd (having to run both \verb@Sweave@ and \verb@latex@
to get anything that looks like the document)?

Well, we can now include R in our document.  Here's a simple example
<<two>>=
2 + 2
@
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@<<two>>=@ \\
\verb@2 + 2@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\end{tabbing}
This is not \LaTeX.  It is a ``code chunk'' to be processed by \verb@Sweave@.
When \verb@Sweave@ hits such a thing, it processes it, runs R to get the
results, and stuffs (by default) the output in the \LaTeX\ file it is
creating.  The \LaTeX\ between code chunks is copied verbatim (except
for \verb@Sexpr@, about which see below).  Hence to create a Rnw document
you just write plain old \LaTeX\ interspersed with ``code chunks'' which
are plain old R.

\pagebreak[3]
Plots get a little more complicated.  First we make something to plot
(simulate regression data).
<<reg>>=
n <- 50
x <- seq(1, n)
a.true <- 3
b.true <- 1.5
y.true <- a.true + b.true * x
s.true <- 17.3
y <- y.true + s.true * rnorm(n)
out1 <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(out1)
@
(for once we won't show the code chunk itself, look at \verb@foo.Rnw@
if you want to see what the actual code chunk was).

Figure~\ref{fig:one} (p.~\pageref{fig:one})
is produced by the following code
<<label=fig1plot,include=FALSE>>=
plot(x, y)
abline(out1)
@
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=fig1,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
<<fig1plot>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{Scatter Plot with Regression Line}
\label{fig:one}
\end{figure}
Note that \verb@x@, \verb@y@, and \verb@out1@ are remembered from
the preceding code chunk.  We don't have to regenerate them.
All code chunks are part of one R ``session''.

Now this was a little tricky.  We did this with two code chunks,
one visible and one invisible.  First we did
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@<<label=fig1plot,include=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@plot(x, y)@ \\
\verb@abline(out1)@ \\
\verb+@+
\end{tabbing}
where the \verb@include=FALSE@ indicates that the output (text and graphics)
should not go here (they will be some place else) and the \verb@label=fig1plot@
gives the code chunk a name (to be used later).  And ``later'' is almost
immediate.  Next we did
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@\begin{figure}@ \\
\verb@\begin{center}@ \\
\verb@<<label=fig1,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@<<fig1plot>>@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\verb@\end{center}@ \\
\verb@\caption{Scatter Plot with Regression Line}@ \\
\verb@\label{fig:one}@ \\
\verb@\end{figure}@
\end{tabbing}
In this code chunk the \verb@fig=TRUE@ indicates that the chunk
generates a figure.  \verb@Sweave@ automagically makes both EPS and PDF
files for the figure and automagically generates an
appropriate \LaTeX\ \verb@\includegraphics@ command
to include the plot in the \verb@figure@ environment.
The \verb@echo=FALSE@ in the code chunk means just what it says
(we've already seen the code---it was produced by the preceding chunk---and
we don't want to see it again, especially not in our figure).
The \verb@<<fig1plot>>@ is an example of ``code chunk reuse''.
It means that we reuse the code of the code chunk named \verb@fig1plot@.
It is important that we observe the DRY/SPOT rule (\emph{don't repeat yourself}
or \emph{single point of truth}) and only have one bit of code for generating
the plot.  What the reader sees is guaranteed to be the code that made the
plot.  If we had used cut-and-paste, just repeating the code, the duplicated
code might get out of sync after edits.
The rest of this should be recognizable to anyone who has ever
done a \LaTeX\ figure.

So making a figure is a bit more complicated in some ways but much simpler
in others.  Note the following virtues
\begin{itemize}
\item The figure is guaranteed to be the one described by the text
(at least by the R in the text).
\item No messing around with sizing or rotations.  It just works!
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=fig2,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
out3 <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3))
plot(x, y)
curve(predict(out3, newdata=data.frame(x=x)), add = TRUE)
@
\end{center}
\caption{Scatter Plot with Cubic Regression Curve}
\label{fig:two}
\end{figure}
Note that if you don't care to show the R code to make the figure,
it is simpler still.  Figure~\ref{fig:two} (p.~\pageref{fig:two})
shows another plot.
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@\begin{figure}@ \\
\verb@\begin{center}@ \\
\verb@<<label=fig2,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@out3 <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3))@ \\
\verb@plot(x, y)@ \\
\verb@curve(predict(out3, newdata=data.frame(x=x)), add = TRUE)@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\verb@\end{center}@ \\
\verb@\caption{Scatter Plot with Cubic Regression Curve}@ \\
\verb@\label{fig:two}@ \\
\verb@\end{figure}@
\end{tabbing}
Now we just included the code for the plot in the figure
(with \verb@echo=FALSE@ so it doesn't show).

Also note that every time we rerun \verb@Sweave@ Figures~\ref{fig:one}
and~\ref{fig:two} change, the latter conspicuously (because the simulated
data are random).  Everything
just works.  This should tell you the main virtue of Sweave.
It's always correct.  There is never a problem with stale
cut-and-paste.

<<foo,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
options(scipen=10)
@
Simple numbers can be plugged into the text with the \verb@\Sexpr@
command, for example, the quadratic and cubic regression coefficients
in the preceding regression were
$\beta_2 = \Sexpr{round(out3$coef[3], 4)}$
and
$\beta_3 = \Sexpr{round(out3$coef[4], 4)}$.
Just magic!
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@in the preceding regression@ \\
\verb@were $\beta_2 = \Se@\verb@xpr{round(out3$coef[3], 4)}$@ \\
\verb@and $\beta_3 = \Se@\verb@xpr{round(out3$coef[4], 4)}$.@
\end{tabbing}
<<foo2,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
options(scipen=0)
@

The \verb@xtable@ command is used to make tables.  (The following
is the \verb@Sweave@ of another code chunk that we don't explicitly
show.  Look at \verb@foo.Rnw@ for details.)
<<blurfle>>=
out2 <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2))
foo <- anova(out1, out2, out3)
foo
class(foo)
dim(foo)
foo <- as.matrix(foo)
foo
@
So now we are ready to turn the matrix \verb@foo@
into Table~\ref{tab:one}
<<label=tab1,echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
library(xtable)
print(xtable(foo, caption = "ANOVA Table", label = "tab:one",
    digits = c(0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3)), table.placement = "tbp",
    caption.placement = "top")
@
using the R chunk
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@<<label=tab1,echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=@ \\
\verb@library(xtable)@ \\
\verb@print(xtable(foo, caption = "ANOVA Table", label = "tab:one",@ \\
\verb@    digits = c(0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3)), table.placement = "tbp",@ \\
\verb@    caption.placement = "top")@ \\
\verb+@+
\end{tabbing}
(note the difference between arguments to the \verb@xtable@ function
and to the \verb@xtable@ method of the \verb@print@ function).

To summarize, \verb@Sweave@ is terrific, so important that soon
we'll not be able to get along without it.  It's virtues are
\begin{itemize}
\item The numbers and graphics you report are actually what they
are claimed to be.
\item Your analysis is reproducible.  Even years later, when you've
completely forgotten what you did, the whole write-up, every single
number or pixel in a plot is reproducible.
\item Your analysis actually works---at least in this particular instance.
The code you show actually executes without error.
\item Toward the end of your work, with the write-up almost done you
discover an error.  Months of rework to do?  No!  Just fix the error
and rerun \verb@Sweave@ and \verb@latex@.  One single problem like
this and you will have all the time invested in \verb@Sweave@ repaid.
\item This methodology provides discipline.
There's nothing that will make you clean up your code like
the prospect of actually revealing it to the world.
\end{itemize}

Whether we're talking about homework, a consulting report, a textbook,
or a research paper.  If they involve computing and statistics,
this is the way to do it.
