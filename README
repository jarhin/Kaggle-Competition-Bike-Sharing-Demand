Welcome to ProjectTemplate!

This file introduces you to ProjectTemplate, but you should eventually replace
the contents of this file with an introduction to your project. People who
work with your data in the future will thank you for it, including your future
self.

ProjectTemplate is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. Since you're reading this file, we'll assume that you've
already called `create.project()` to set up this project and all of its
contents.

To load your new project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

This project requires the following R packages to run all of the analyses:

reshape, plyr, ggplot2, stringr, lubridate, dplyr, forecast, xts.

To run all the analyses and generate all the images and models run the 
following line of code after the lines of R code above:
	run.project()
